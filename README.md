# Link-Prediction-Mesh-Network
Submodule of [Meshtastic Emergency Response Client](https://github.com/ajmcquilkin/Meshtastic-emergency-response-client)
 
This is a repository for ongoing research on future link prediction in mesh networks using graph neural networks. The [paper](https://github.com/barkincavdaroglu/Link-Prediction-Mesh-Network/blob/main/Mesh%20Link%20Prediction%20-%20Working%20Paper.pdf) will be updated regularly, and once the model design is finalized, we will share the code implementation here.

The model currently achieves state-of-the-art performance of RMSE of 2.7 with METR-LA dataset of horizon 3.
