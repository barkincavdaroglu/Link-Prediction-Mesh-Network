# Link-Prediction-Mesh-Network

 ![Architecture](https://github.com/barkincavdaroglu/Link-Prediction-Mesh-Network/blob/main/fullarch.pngg)
This is a repository for ongoing research on future link prediction in mesh networks using graph neural networks. The [paper](https://github.com/barkincavdaroglu/Link-Prediction-Mesh-Network/blob/main/Mesh%20Link%20Prediction%20-%20Working%20Paper.pdf) will be updated regularly, and once the model design is finalized, we will share the code implementation here.
